## Project Requirements
1. Using only the Main Camera to create a first person walking environment. Do not import Unity FPS package. You have to write your own script to control the Main Camera. Make sure you can use "WSAD" to walk in the gallery forward, back, left, right, use the mouse to change the walking direction and looking around. (10%)
2. Create another controller's profile that is using "TGFH" to walk in the gallery forward, back, left, right, use "Left" and "Right" arrow keys to change the walking direction and looking around.(10%)
3. Create a 2D GUI for your health and set it to 100 by default. (10%)
4. Create 2D GUI to switch between two controllers' profile. (10%)
5. Create 2D GUI to enable customizing every single input key. (10%)
6. Create a Cube in the environment as an enemy. When you hit the cube, you will lose 5 of your health, and show it from the 2D health GUI. (10%)
7. If your health is less than 100, your health will be automatically restored by 2 if you did not hit the cube more than 10 seconds. (Restored by 2 every 10 seconds if there is no hit) If you hit the cube within 10 seconds, the timer has to be reset. (10%)
8. Create a projectile script to use left mouse button to shoot one sphere randomly selected from two different sizes and colors to your front in the environment. And kill the sphere after 5 seconds or hit the enemy. The bigger size sphere will cause 20 damage to the enemy, and the smaller size sphere will cause 10 damage to the enemy. (20%)
9. Create a 3D GUI for the enemy's health. When the enemy was hit by the sphere, the enemy loses the corresponding health. If the enemy's health is less or equal to 0, it will be destroyed (disappear from the environment) (10%)
